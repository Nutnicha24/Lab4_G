The Emperor's New Clothes by Hans Christian Andersen

Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. 
He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, 
except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; 
and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, "he is sitting in council," it was always said of him, "The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe.

" Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, 
calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, 
the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, 
or who was extraordinarily simple in character.

"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!" thought the Emperor. "Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, 
and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately." 
And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly. 

So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. 
They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own knapsacks; 
and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night.

"Well, Sir Minister!" said one of the knaves, still pretending to work. "You do not say whether the stuff pleases you."
"Oh, it is excellent!" replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. 
"This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We shall be much obliged to you," said the impostors, and then they named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended stuff. The old minister listened attentively to
their words, in order that he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun. 
However,they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looms.
The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. It was just the same with this gentleman as
with the minister; he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.
